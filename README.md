# Woman First DNA Methylation (Guatemala)

This is the repository for the Woman First methylation analysis and results.

The two research questions of interest were:
1) Are study arm and maternal BMI associated with infant DNA methylation at birth?
2) Is infant DNA methylation associated with age-adjusted birth outcomes?
